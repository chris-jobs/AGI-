# AGI-

As for me, I write. And it's not because writing is how I make a living. As far back as I can remember, I have always considered myself a writer. Not because someone commissioned me to do so, but because I possessed an inclination to do so. I felt an urgent desire to express myself via writing, and I continue to feel this way now. However, there are stretches of time where I don't put pen to paper. And now all the things I had meant to write are gone, buried under a mountain of fresh, not necessarily superior, thoughts.


If you've been writing for any length of time, you've undoubtedly experienced periods of change like these. That's why I refer to them as "transitions," since that's really what they are: patches. There are many types of transitions: the passage from one relationship to another, from one mood to another, from one place of residence to another, and so on. When that happens, the motivation to write lags behind the words.


These days, I'm going through a period of change as I try to figure out who my target audience is. Whom exactly am I writing for? Me? Or the many? Where do I draw the line between baring my soul and contributing to the day's trending articles? Who exactly am I writing for? One more human? Or a computer program with a fake soul?


Writing was lot simpler when I was younger. There are no guidelines, and nobody is judging anybody. Nothing except reams of text, paragraphs, and tidbits of narratives. Possibly childish, but undeniably adorable all the same. All I did back then was practice writing down thoughts that delighted me and then trying to do my best to capture that excitement in words without destroying the experience. My only wish was that someday other people might get as much enjoyment out of reading my stories as I had while I was writing them.


When my confidence was high, I'd share one of these tales with a close relative or close friend. With clammy hands I'd approach them and offer, "Want to read something I wrote?" My notebooks had old covers and tattered pages. And at that point, I would gladly surrender my organs.


This was the way things worked back then. Even though it was difficult to see anything, the payoffs felt endless. When I was younger, I discovered a passion for writing; the question is, does that passion still burn as brightly today?


The transition from pen and paper to typewriters and word processors has been a boon to my writing. Referring to digital writing tools such as word processors, weblogs, and other online spaces for authors. There was a steep learning curve associated with each new tool, but I'm confident that they all helped me show and disseminate my work more effectively. The medium is always shifting, and I have to adapt to suit its changing whims and desires.


Please don't misinterpret me. The use of search engine optimization is something I experiment with. I try to employ such strategies as linking to related content and drawing in new readers. Click-bait titles and images are discussed, and it is a mad dash to find something that has even a passing resemblance to what it is I want to say. I take these measures in the vain expectation of attracting the attention of Google's index and, of course, the algorithm that rules them all. I come to them with much ceremony and dignity, yet my request is one of humility. Put me in touch with your reader.


Does anyone find this unsettling?


Forgive my pessimism, but it seems like the volume of stuff being created every day must be overwhelming for any single person, let alone a large group of people. It seems sense that we would benefit from turning this material over to an automated system, the more advanced of which the better. As we lighten our loads by giving up more and more power, I can't help but believe that submission is the first step toward dominance.


We are not there yet. There is, in my opinion, sufficient time left to abandon the inhumane course and instead prioritize maintaining human connection. But for the time being, with so many of us learning the way of the algorithm, it is difficult to foresee any kind of change. Until this shift occurs and the medium changes again, I must accept a terrifying reality: I write for machines.


Many of us are guilty of this.


Most of us want our words to have impact and endure long after we are gone. We don't want them to wither away in the same worn notebook where we jotted them down. If that means accommodating the electronic entity of the day, we'll do it to ensure they have the greatest possible chance of survival and reach a wider audience through curation.


Yet, gradually but surely, we are entering the age of algorithms. However, we have treated the algorithm as a mystery to be solved, continuing our careless attitude thus far. Earning points in the algorithm's favor runs the risk of becoming us reliant on its verdicts.


Even if we enter this massive content processor with the finest of motives, can we have faith that it will bring us happiness? To give us the liberty to think and speak as we choose?


I worry that one day everyone, not just authors, will genuflect and mutter a prayer.


Awe-Inspiring Algorithm! We ask for your blessing. So that You can show us the way to happiness."


On that date, I will make the reverse transition. To the nearest human I will hobble, sweaty palms resting on a worn notebook, and ask, "Want to read something I wrote?"


And what would I say to this algorithm, this artificial judge in the new day? Mitigate this!
